### What is the general question/topic being investigated?

---

- What motivates an end of empire?
- Why do not powerful countries seek to colonize weak countries, or expand their territories?

### Argument(s)/Explanation(s): What is the theory? What do the authors expect to find? Why?

---

- Existing explanations
    - Imperialism
        - Demand-side: riches, resources, markets, or jobs in metropolis
        - Supply-side: conquest (to redeem the demands) in target
        - System-level: *Dependence theory, long-cycle theory*
    - Decolonization
        - *Domestic politics in metropolis*
            - The need of landed nobles (Autocracy) vs. Democracy
        - International factors
            - *Demonstration effect*
            - *The rise of an anti-imperialist bipolar system during the* Cold War.
- Offer a theory of imperialism and decolonization based on the dynamic of systemic structure, military technology, and economic development.
    - Military < Capital?
    - Conquest < Commerce
- Productivity → Power in the modern
    - However, if inputs again become scare, if military tech lowers occupation costs, or if powerful nations fail to perpetuate and abet open market, empire will come back.
- Micro-foundations for colonial expansion and decline.
    1. Military effectiveness
        - European expansion and colonization took place in the context of dramatic increases in the administrative, transportation and military capabilities of European states (532)
        - Without these advantages, do metropolis have motivations for empire?
    2. Economic Development
        - How much nations profited from empire.
        - Perceived economic benefit to key constituencies or decision makers → the value of empire declined.
    3. *Imperialists' Dilemma: Mercantilism Made Me Do It*
        - *Imperialist occupation → possible future profits would never arise.*
- Treats preference of r territorial aggression as a variable driven by environmental conditions that can recur or trend over time.
- Model
    - Basic model (the effects of power, technology, and economic development)
    - Second model: Domestic political liberalization
    - Third model: The role of system effects (mecantilism)

### Type of Analysis: How do the authors test their argument?

---

- Establish formal models
- Test the implications from the formal models with empirical data in quantitative manner.

### What is the sample? What cases do the authors look at? How broad is their coverage?

---

Countries from 1816 to 1992. Unit of analysis is country-year.

### Finding(s): What do the authors conclude based on the evidence?

---

- "The desire to control land   remains strong in the developing world."
- "Successful development could increase middle tier, which is against territorial aggression."
- Tech. innovation"→ Labor costs " = Costly empire.
- However, decline of empire is not deterministic → It can recur or revive.
