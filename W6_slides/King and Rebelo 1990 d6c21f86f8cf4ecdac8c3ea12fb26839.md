### What is the general question/topic being investigated?

---

- Why do the countries of the world display considerable disparity in long-term growth rates?
    - 왜 국가들 간의 장기 성장률의 차이가 나타날까?

### Argument(s)/Explanation(s): What is the theory? What do the authors expect to find? Why?

---

- Existing explanations
    - Schultz (1981): modest variations in tax rates are associated with large variations in long-run growth rates.
    - Neoclassical models of economic growth: Old and new
        - Basic neoclassical model: Output = F(K (physical capital = tools) NX (labor = Technical progress $\times$ labor input)
        - What did they miss? Only considered the endogenous effect of economic growth on physical capitals, but not labor input—human capital.
        - Existing neoclassical model argues that only population growth and technology progress have exogenous effect on economic growth in the long-run.
            - It implies that public policies have short-term effect.
            - Does not explain how public policies can affect economic growth in the long-run.
- ***Arguments***
    - National public policies → individual incentives → levels of accumulation in physical and human forms.
    - Stagnation or High economic growth ~ *f*(Changes in public policy)
        - 정부의 인프라 투자 등의 지출과 같은 생산성 지출이 생산요소 및 생산성에 영향을 주어 경제성장에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있다.
        - The steady-state effects of an increase in the rate of income tax from 20% to 30% are an 18.2% drop in the capital stock and a 3.6% drop in consumption.

### Type of Analysis: How do the authors test their argument?

---

- Two-sector endogenous growth model with simulation and experiments.

### What is the sample? What cases do the authors look at? How broad is their coverage?

---

- Unit of analysis is state.

### Finding(s): What do the authors conclude based on the evidence?

---

- National taxation can substantially affect long-run growth rates.
- National taxation can lead to development traps or to growth miracles for small open economies with substantial capital mobility.
- Taxation may affect the growth rate in an important way, but that the magnitude of the influence depends on the production and tax structure.

### Key words/phrases or unclear words/phrases

---

### Follow-up questions

---

- Limitations
    - Budget ≠ Actual expenditure (can affect public policies' effects on economic growth or even make bias.)
