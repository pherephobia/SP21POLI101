### What is the general question/topic being investigated?

---

- What is the relationship between socio-economic development and political democracy?
- Are poor countries less likely to be democratic than rich countries?

### Argument(s)/Explanation(s): What is the theory? What do the authors expect to find? Why?

---

- Lipset (1959), *Modernization theory*
    - The more develops, the more likely to be/sustain democracy.
    - Development $\rightarrow$Democracy
        - Here, development means:
            1. Industrialization
            2. Urbanization
            3. Wealth
            4. Education
        - *Middle class* leads a society to democracy, fostering democratic culture.
        - Moore (1966) also emphasizes the *bourgeoisie* for democracy.

    Figure 1: Modernization Theory according to Lipset.

- Huntington (1968) consider modernization as one of the factors driving democratization.
- Why the variation in the results?
    1. Selection bias: cases
    2. CS or TSCS
    3. Relevant ctrl
    4. Measurement validity of democracy
    5. Model specification: linear? non-linear?

### Competing theories

- Exogeneous: Development merely help sustain democracy once it is established.
- Endogenous: (Economic) Development bring about democracy; Development makes democracies more likely to emerge and endure.

### Recent Developments

1. Robustness: methodologically
2. Mechanism: new variable, *Inequality / values and Demands*

### Type of Analysis: How do the authors test their argument?

---

- Literature reviews

### What is the sample? What cases do the authors look at? How broad is their coverage?

---

- Research on democratization from Lipset (1957) to recent (2009).

### Finding(s): What do the authors conclude based on the evidence?

---

- The macro effect of modernization on democracy is perhaps less doubted than ever among scholars.
- Democracy does not come about randomly, and for democracy to be stable it must come about from within, since it is the socio-economic conditions which create and maintain an environment for stable and enduring democracies.
- For an effective promotion of democracy, as it is part of many foreign policies, socio-economic development must be a central component.
